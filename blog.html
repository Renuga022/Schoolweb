          <p>The importance of early childhood education can never be stressed enough. The emotional, social and physical development of your child will have a direct effect on their overall development and on the adult they will become.</p>
          <br />
          <p>The International Preschool Curriculum was developed to raise the standard of preschool education, designing it to be more global and all-encompassing, focusing on improving and enhancing the whole individual. All across the world today, families, teachers and communities are experiencing the enormous benefits of IPC’s world-class curriculum. Present now in over 100 schools, across 6 continents, IPC has introduced a more progressive and innovative global education system.The IPC curriculum was founded with the intention of promoting cultural harmony through progressive and global education and all the curricula are designed to cultivate critical thinking, enhance self-awareness and promote plurality through an understanding of other cultures.

Based on proven and peer-review concepts, the IPC curriculum is professionally designed in-house by the IPC design-studio, who works closely with individual governments to tailor the curricula materials to ensure local compliance.
